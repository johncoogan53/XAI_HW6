# XAI_HW6

This project will use ICE, ALE, and PDP explainable techniques. We will utilize cell phone usage data to look at the relationship between age and screen time. See HW6.ipynb for more details.

For AlePython installation, installing from source was preferrable to pip install alepython which had issues:
pip install git+https://github.com/MaximeJumelle/ALEPython.git@dev#egg=alepython
